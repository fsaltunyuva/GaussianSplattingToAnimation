# Gaussian Splatting To Animation
A Unity project to animate a Guassian Splatting 3D model and control with the input. The only process needed to create the real-life human body into a 3D object was recording a video of a human by moving around him and using the Gaussian Splatting process to get the 3D model output.

This project includes a 3D human model which is generated by [Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and animated using the [Adobe Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/). Used walking, running, and jumping animations from Adobe Mixamo, and with the help of these animations, the human body can move around a scene with keyboard input.
